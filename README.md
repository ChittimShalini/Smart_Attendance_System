# Smart_Attendance_System
A automated attendance System

## Overview
The Smart Attendance System is an innovative solution designed to automate attendance marking from a group photo. Using advanced face recognition technologies, it identifies individuals in the photo and records their attendance in a CSV file. The system also provides visualizations of attendance data for easy analysis.

**Note**
This project is currently in its initial phase and has been tested with a limited dataset. Extensive testing with larger and more diverse datasets is required to ensure robustness and reliability in real-world scenarios.

## Features
- Automatic face detection and recognition from group photos.
- Attendance marking with timestamp in a CSV file.
- Support for individual photo datasets for identification.
- Visualization of attendance records using Matplotlib.
